# ConferenceWebApp

Automatic Generation of Conference Programmes.

The objective of this project is to develop a software system that assists in creating an optimized schedule for a scientific conference. The conference schedule typically includes parallel sessions with related topics and plenary sessions with invited speakers. The challenge is to minimize conflicts in the schedule, ensuring that participants can attend talks of interest without overlapping sessions. The project will involve designing, implementing, and evaluating a web application that allows conference organizers to input schedule and paper information while enabling participants to express their preferences for talks they wish to attend. The software will then generate a conference schedule that minimizes conflicts and possibly optimizes other relevant criteria. The paper "Conference Scheduling - A Personalized Approach" (PATAT 2016) serves as inspiration for this project's development.
